 Day 2 – Networking Fundamentals and Nmap Scanning:

I learned how networks work by studying the OSI and TCP/IP models, which explain how data travels across devices.
And I explored key concepts like IP addresses, MAC addresses, ports, and protocols.
Then, I used basic terminal commands to find my IP, test connectivity, and trace routes.
After that, I worked with Nmap to scan my own system and local network—identifying live devices, open ports, and running services.
Finally, I saved my scan results and reviewed key Nmap flags and networking terms.
